<span class="name">Matt Ehrke – Drums</span><p>I started playing drums when I was just a little guy, my mom caught me getting out pots and spoons to beat the pots with when I was 2 1/2, and I got my 1st legit set when I was 7. Music and drumming is a release like no other for me. As soon as I started playing I knew I wanted to play for the rest of my life, because as soon as I can remember, I loved playing. Music is a way to put your voice out there and an amazing way to show the creativity in ones soul.</p>

<p>Music brings people together and that's something I have always wanted to do. For me, music has been that outlet I could turn to and count on to connect with something bigger than myself. Growing up, my mom would ask me after a song played on the radio to think about what the lyrics meant. Now with every word I write and sing, I make sure I can give a message to people so they know that whatever it is they are going through, they aren't alone.</p>
